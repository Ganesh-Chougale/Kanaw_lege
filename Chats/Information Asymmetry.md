most of people thinks that hardcore dieting, fasting will cause their weightloss. & the fat is release via sweat & urine.

but I heard that a regular cardio (speciacally a heart rate where you can do cardio & able to talk at same rate is ideal fat burning spot), & the fat is released via exhaling

how much of this is true?

You're actually spot on! Here’s the breakdown:  

1. **Fat Loss Mechanism** – Fat is primarily broken down into **carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O)**. Around **84% of fat leaves your body through exhaling CO₂**, and the remaining **16% is excreted via sweat, urine, and other fluids**. So, most fat loss literally happens through breathing!  

2. **Cardio & Fat Burning Zone** – The "talking while doing cardio" rule is a rough way to measure **Zone 2 heart rate (60–70% of max HR)**, which is optimal for fat burning. This is because your body primarily uses **fat for energy at lower intensities** rather than relying on quick-burning carbs.  

3. **Fasting & Hardcore Dieting?** – Extreme fasting or crash diets often **slow down metabolism**, leading to **muscle loss** rather than efficient fat loss. Sustainable weight loss comes from **consistent calorie deficit + activity** rather than extreme restrictions.  

So yeah, the idea that fat "melts away through sweat" is a myth. It’s mostly **exhaled** as CO₂ when you burn it for energy.

ok this was just to initiate the chat for the actual reason.
I want to know this term here, I'll explain this is my own word try to understand it.

in recent message I was trying to tell you how majority of people don't know actual information or half information.

& only 1-5% of people know the truth or actual & full information.

so is there any definition, term, word for this?

Yeah, what you're describing is often referred to as the **"Pareto Principle" (80/20 Rule)** or **"Knowledge Gap"**, but there's a more fitting term:  

### **The 1% Rule (Internet Participation Inequality)**  
It suggests that **1% of people create knowledge (experts), 9% engage with it, and 90% passively consume or have partial/misinformed knowledge.**  

Other related terms:  
- **Dunning-Kruger Effect** – Many think they know a lot but actually don’t. True experts realize how much they *don’t* know.  
- **The Lindy Effect** – Truth survives over time, but myths/misinformation spread faster.  
- **The Matthew Effect** – "The rich get richer" but applies to knowledge—those who know gain more, while the misinformed stay misinformed.  

The closest general term is **"Information Asymmetry"**, where a small % of people have the full picture while the majority operate on limited/false knowledge.
